            <h2>2Nephi 2:25-26</h2>
            <p>
                Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy.
                <br><br>
                And the Messiah cometh in the fulness of time, that he may redeem the children of men from the fall. And because that they are redeemed from the fall they have
                    become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not be acted upon, save it be by the punishment of the law at the great and last day,
                    according to the commandments which God hath given.

            <h2>Moses 1:37-39</h2>
            <p>
                And the Lord God spake unot Moses, saying: The heavens, they are many, and they cannot be numbered unto man; but they are numbered unto me, for they are mine.
                <br><br>
                And as one earth shall pass away, and the heavens thereof even so shall another come; and there is no end to my works, neither to my words.
                <br><br>
                For behold, this is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.
